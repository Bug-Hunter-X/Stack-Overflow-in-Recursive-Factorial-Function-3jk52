This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive factorial function. The error occurs because the function does not handle negative input values correctly and the recursive calls exceed the maximum recursion depth.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle such scenarios by adding an appropriate base case and using a larger data type.
